    Aurora exists so people can support a broad range of projects responding to the coalface needs of our community. We are the organisation people choose when they want their money to benefit the little groups doing big things.

  Supporting Aurora means you join us in our commitment to raise funds through events that engage and celebrate the LGBTIQ community while empowering grass roots organisations to have the capacity to maximise their outreach and impact and ensure their projects are successfully realised.

    Kaldi is the ultimate spot for coffee lovers who want to learn about their
    java’s origin and support the farmers that grew it. We take coffee
    production, roasting and brewing seriously and we’re glad to pass that
    knowledge to anyone. This is an edit via identity...

  heading: Great coffee with no compromises
  description: >
    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
