The Aurora Group is ringing in the new decade by supporting a record number of grants for powerful LGBTIQ+ community projects.

“This year, we are delighted to announce that a record 14 organisations will share in funding to support essential projects and empower the LGBTIQ+ community,” said Aurora Chair, Sam Turner.

“After receiving a high number of applications and going through a difficult decision-making process, Aurora is proud to be able to spread funding from Tamworth and surrounds, to Western Sydney, the Hunter and digitally across the nation in 2020,” Sam said.

“Aurora exists to help ensure LGBTIQ+ people and communities are not left behind. This year we have a strong focus on projects that support young people and people of colour, as well as the trans and gender diverse community, in projects that reach far beyond the city centre.”

## Proud partner

Westpac has again shown their support, kicking in $10,000 for a Special Grant over two years that will support OutLoud to run a project collaborating with the Muslim community to provide a mental health safety net for young LGBTIQ+ people in South West Sydney.

And PwC Australia, along with Westpac, continue to support Special Grants in their second year of funding in 2020.

## The full list of projects supported by Aurora in 2020 include: 

- Blacktown Youth Services Association together with AllOut Blacktown – Establishing a safe space for LGBTIQ+ young people in the Blacktown area;
- Tamworth Aboriginal Medical Services – Establishing a youth network for LGBTIQ+ identifying people across the Tamworth and Gunnedah region with specialist support;
- Hunter Gender Alliance – Delivering a series of workshops for trans and gender diverse young people in the Hunter Region;
